## Description of the project 
This dataset contains the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees from January 1, 2012 to current.The following questions we seek to answer focus on trends and anomalies surrounding the sales of liquor in the state of Iowa.


## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers 
- What times of the year have liquor sales been the highest? 
- Are there hotspots in the state where liquor sales have been higher than the average?
- Can we see if there are preferred liquor types for regions or cities?
- Based on the above three questions, can we tailor advertisements to increase sales of a certain liquor?
- Is there a surprising/unexpected time of year when liquor sales have gone up?
- Are there purchase trends during holidays and college football season?
- What have the average liquor prices in cities during holidays been? 
- With this information we can predict what the highest price a customer is willing to pay before sales start to drop off
